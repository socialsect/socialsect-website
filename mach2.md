# Mach2 MVP Proposal — Phase 1 Validation Build  
**Prepared by Socialsect**  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

Mach2 is entering a pivotal stage, where the success of its pivot to B2C depends on a single priority: **market validation**.  

The immediate objective is to test whether end users will engage with the platform in its simplest, most frictionless form. This requires a streamlined approach that minimizes technical complexity while capturing essential data on user demand and operator responsiveness.  

The Phase 1 build proposed here focuses exclusively on the core elements necessary for this validation:  

- **Trip Requests**: End-users can submit charter requests with minimal input.  
- **Operator Engagement**: Operators can respond seamlessly via email, without the need to log in to a separate platform.  
- **Quote Visibility**: Users can receive, compare, and act on operator quotes in a clear and trustworthy interface.  

All additional features — such as advanced dashboards, AI-driven recommendations, and integrations — are deliberately deferred until validation confirms user adoption and operator participation. This ensures investment is directed toward proving the concept before scaling.

## 2. Business Drivers  

The strategic direction for this phase is guided by five critical drivers:  

- **Validation First**  
  Establish clear evidence of market demand by enabling end-user traction before committing significant resources to expansion.  

- **Operator Efficiency**  
  Remove friction for operators by eliminating additional logins and allowing replies directly via email, ensuring rapid adoption.  

- **User Confidence**  
  Deliver transparent notifications and intuitive quote comparisons to build trust and encourage conversion.  

- **Speed to Market**  
  Prioritize a rapid development cycle, targeting deployment within weeks to capture early insights and accelerate learning.  

- **Scalable Foundation**  
  Architect the solution to support future growth and advanced functionality without requiring a full rebuild.

## 3. Phase 1 Scope  

Phase 1 is designed to deliver only the essential functionality required to validate the B2C model, while ensuring minimal friction for both users and operators.  

### End-User Flow  
- Submit trip requests by entering origin, destination, travel date, and passenger details.  
- Receive confirmation via SMS and push notification confirming the request has been dispatched.  
- Be notified in real time as operator quotes are received.  
- View, compare, and select from available quotes in a simple interface.  

### Operator Flow  
- Receive charter requests directly by email.  
- Respond with a quote by replying to the email, without needing to log in to a separate platform.  
- Have responses automatically parsed and captured within the Mach2 system.  

### Administration Flow  
- Curate and maintain the operator distribution lists.  
- Manage request and response templates to ensure clarity and consistency.  
- Monitor operator responsiveness and basic service-level adherence.  

This scope provides the leanest path to validation, ensuring the platform delivers immediate usability for end-users while reducing adoption barriers for operators.

## 4. Roadmap & Timeline  

The proposed delivery plan emphasizes speed to market while maintaining quality and control. The following timeline outlines the phased approach for the Phase 1 validation build:  

- **Weeks 1–2**: Establish core infrastructure including API endpoints, database schema, and trip request submission flow.  
- **Weeks 3–4**: Implement email dispatch system and automated parsing of operator replies.  
- **Weeks 5–6**: Integrate user notifications (SMS and push) and develop the quote comparison interface.  
- **Weeks 7–8**: Conduct quality assurance, run a pilot with selected operators, and align with PPC campaigns for live validation.  

**Estimated Duration**: 6–8 weeks  

> *This timeline is indicative. Final scheduling will be confirmed once dedicated development resources are in place, ensuring feasibility and alignment with Mach2’s objectives.*

## 5. Costing & Market Comparison  

To ensure flexibility and transparency, pricing is presented as a range rather than a fixed figure. This approach allows control to remain with the Mach2 team in determining how lean or how comprehensive the Phase 1 build should be.  

### Option A — Validation Build  
- **Estimated Range**: $20,000 – $25,000  
- **Inclusions**: Core request form, operator email workflow, basic notifications, and simple administrative controls.  
- **Purpose**: Deliver rapid validation of the B2C model with minimal upfront investment.  

### Option B — Validation + Foundation  
- **Estimated Range**: $30,000 – $45,000  
- **Inclusions**: All features from Option A, enhanced with SLA tracking, operator engagement metrics, an analytics dashboard, and stronger administrative tooling.  
- **Purpose**: Validate market demand while simultaneously establishing a stronger foundation to provide stakeholders with deeper insights and long-term scalability.  

### Market Benchmarking  
Comparable builds commissioned with **US-based development firms** would typically fall in the **$90,000–$120,000+ range**, while **UK-based firms** would quote between **£65,000–£90,000**.  

The proposed model therefore delivers equivalent enterprise-grade quality at approximately one-third of the cost, while maintaining the speed and agility required for validation.

## 6. Monthly Maintenance (Post-Launch)  

Following the launch of Phase 1, ongoing maintenance will be essential to ensure stability, reliability, and the ability to act quickly on user feedback.  

- **Estimated Range**: $3,000 – $4,500 per month  
- **Coverage**: Bug fixes, system monitoring, security patches, and incremental improvements based on early operator and user feedback.  
- **Objective**: Guarantee that the MVP remains stable in production, while creating the flexibility to adapt and refine features as validation insights emerge.  

This model ensures the platform is continuously supported without requiring major reinvestment during the validation period.

## 7. Governance & Reporting  

Effective governance and transparent reporting will ensure alignment throughout the build process:  

- **Progress Visibility**: Weekly updates and live demonstrations to provide full transparency on development milestones.  
- **Cost Transparency**: Infrastructure services such as AWS, Mailgun, and Twilio billed directly to Mach2, typically in the range of **$300–600 per month**, with no hidden charges.  
- **Control and Flexibility**: Scope and pacing decisions remain with Mach2 at every stage, ensuring the project evolves in line with strategic priorities.  

This structure minimizes risk while keeping decision-making firmly in the hands of the Mach2 leadership team.

## 9. Next Steps  

To initiate the Phase 1 validation build, the following steps are recommended:  

1. **Scope Confirmation**: Confirm selection between Option A (Validation Build) and Option B (Validation + Foundation).  
2. **Commercial Agreement**: Align on the payment structure — for example, 40% on project initiation, 30% at mid-point, and 30% upon delivery.  
3. **Project Kickoff**: Commence development of the Phase 1 validation build in accordance with the agreed scope.  
4. **Validation Campaign**: Launch the PPC campaign in parallel with the MVP release to capture early user data and validate market traction.  

This sequence ensures clarity, controlled investment, and rapid movement toward market validation.
